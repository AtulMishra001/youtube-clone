# YouTube Clone - MERN Stack Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack YouTube clone built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It replicates core video-sharing functionalities, including user authentication, video playback, channel management, and real-time interaction through comments and likes. The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a high-quality user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
* **React.js (Vite)**: For building the user interface with high performance.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive styling and layout.
* **React Router**: For client-side navigation and routing.
* **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
* **React Icons**: For professional iconography (Material Design, IonIcons).

### Backend
* **Node.js & Express.js**: For building a scalable and secure RESTful API.
* **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For flexible data modeling and cloud database storage.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure, token-based user authentication.
* **ES Modules**: Modern JavaScript syntax for clean and maintainable backend code.

## Features
* **Authentication**: JWT-based login and signup with secure password handling.
* **Home Page**: Dynamic video grid with title search and category-based filtering.
* **Responsive Navigation**: Toggleable sidebar and a mobile-optimized search overlay.
* **Video Player**: Seamless playback with like/dislike interactions and view counting.
* **Channel Page**: Ability to 
create/edit/delete videos 
* **Comment System**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for comments.
* **My Channels**: Users can create channels and manage them.
* **Subscription Page**: User can see videos from subscribed channels.
